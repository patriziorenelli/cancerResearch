## Thesis project for a bachelor's degree in computer science at the "La Sapienza" University of Rome
Implementation of an automatic system for downloading, analyzing and archiving the data provided by the CDA (Cancer Data Aggregator) client in a SQL database which extracts its data from the NIH (NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE) partners:
 * [GDC (GENOMIC DATA COMMONS)]( https://gdc.cancer.gov/)
 * [PDC (IMAGING DATA COMMONS)](https://proteomic.datacommons.cancer.gov/pdc/)
 * [IDC (PROTEOMIC DATA COMMONS)](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/repository/imaging-data-commons)
 * [CDS (CANCER DATA SERVICE)](https://dataservice.datacommons.cancer.gov/#/home)

## To be more precise, at the moment we are not using the CDA client exclusively

## Project under development
